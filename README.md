# ðŸ“£ Project Title: EchoBoard â€“ A Feedback & Rating System

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement
Organizations and teams need a reliable and easy-to-use system to collect, store, and manage feedback from users or employees about products, services, or internal tools. In the absence of such a system, valuable insights often get lost or ignored, leading to missed opportunities for improvement.

You are tasked with building EchoBoard, a lightweight Feedback & Rating System using the MERN stack with MySQL. The system should allow users to:

- Submit feedback for specific products or services

- View all submitted feedback entries

- Delete inappropriate feedback (admin-only)

This project will simulate a real-world API application where database design, API development, and collaboration between frontend and backend teams are essential.
